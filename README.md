# horner-eval

## Usage
Add this to your `Cargo.toml`
```toml
[dependencies]
horner-eval = "0.1.0"
```
## Description

If [Horner's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method) is appropriate for your polynomial, then, almost assuredly, you want to unroll
the loop. The `horner!` macro provided by this crate does just that.
